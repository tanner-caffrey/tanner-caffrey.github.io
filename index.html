    <p>hello welcome to my perfect little webbed site</p>
    <p>yes it's supposed to look like this</p>

    <p><h1>it's me, tanner</h1></p>
    <p>i write code / program / babysit computers / whatever you wanna call it</p>
    <p>this site is mostly self-hosted on a 3d printed server in my office and will probably break in places when i'm experimenting and learning new things</p>
    <br>
    <p>i also have a cat with thumbs named <a href="catbook.html"><span class="purple">gwynnie</span></a> and she has PLOTS and SCHEMES and will BITE you affectionately</p>
    <p>she also steals the things i make and puts them up for sale on <a href="https://store.gwynnie.gay"><span class="purple">store so she can buy equipment for her plots and schemes</span></a></p>
